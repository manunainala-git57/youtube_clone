# YouTube Clone

Welcome to my **YouTube Clone** project! This is a simplified, responsive replica of YouTube, built entirely with **HTML** and **CSS**. The goal was to recreate the visual layout of YouTube, focusing on the homepage, including a navbar, video grid, and side menu with thumbnails representing some of my favorite videos.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Adjusts to various screen sizes for an optimal viewing experience on desktop and mobile devices.
- **Custom Thumbnails**: Showcasing some of my favorite video thumbnails to enhance the look of the grid.
- **CSS Styling**: Mimics the style and layout of YouTube, with an emphasis on simplicity and clean design.
